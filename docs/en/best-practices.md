# Best Practices Guide

> **🌐 Language:** **English** | [Español](../es/mejores-practicas.md)

Enterprise-grade best practices for Power Platform tenant-to-tenant migrations.

## 🎯 Pre-Migration Planning

### Environment Assessment
- **Audit current environment** 6-8 weeks before migration
- **Identify critical business processes** that depend on Power Platform
- **Map all integrations** with external systems, SharePoint, Teams
- **Document custom connectors** and their authentication requirements
- **Review data residency** and compliance requirements

### Stakeholder Communication
```
Timeline: 6 weeks before migration
├── Week -6: Initial stakeholder notification
├── Week -4: Detailed migration plan presentation  
├── Week -2: Final confirmation and go/no-go decision
├── Week -1: User communication and training
└── Week 0: Migration execution
```

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Level | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **High** | Business Critical Flows Down | Medium | Test environment migration first |
| **High** | Data Loss | Low | Full backup + validation procedures |
| **Medium** | Extended Downtime | Medium | Staggered migration approach |
| **Medium** | User Authentication Issues | High | Pre-validate all user mappings |
| **Low** | Connector Reconfiguration | High | Document all connectors beforehand |

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

### Access Management
```powershell
# Principle of least privilege for migration accounts
$migrationAccount = "migration-service@company.com"

# Required roles (minimum):
# - Power Platform Administrator (source tenant)
# - Power Platform Administrator (target tenant)  
# - Global Administrator (both tenants, for approval only)

# Recommended: Use dedicated service accounts
# Avoid using personal admin accounts
```

### Data Protection
- **Enable audit logging** in both tenants before migration
- **Export audit logs** for compliance records
- **Validate GDPR compliance** for cross-tenant data transfer
- **Document data classification** and ensure appropriate handling
- **Implement data loss prevention policies** in target tenant

### Network Security
```powershell
# Whitelist required endpoints
$endpoints = @(
    "*.powerapps.com",
    "*.api.powerapps.com", 
    "*.bap.microsoft.com",
    "login.microsoftonline.com",
    "graph.microsoft.com"
)

# Ensure corporate firewalls allow these endpoints
# Consider using conditional access policies
```

## 🔄 Migration Strategy Patterns

### Pattern 1: Big Bang Migration
**When to Use:** Small environments (<50 flows, <20 apps)
```
Pros: ✅ Single cutover, minimal complexity
Cons: ❌ Higher risk, longer downtime
Timeline: 1 day execution
```

### Pattern 2: Phased Migration  
**When to Use:** Large environments (>100 flows, >50 apps)
```
Phase 1: Non-critical development environments
Phase 2: Test/staging environments  
Phase 3: Production environment
Timeline: 2-3 weeks total
```

### Pattern 3: Parallel Run
**When to Use:** Mission-critical environments
```
Step 1: Migrate to target tenant
Step 2: Run both environments in parallel
Step 3: Gradual cutover by business unit
Timeline: 4-6 weeks total
```

## 🚀 Execution Best Practices

### Migration Day Workflow
```powershell
# Hour 0: Pre-flight checks
./MigrationRunbook.ps1 -Phase Prerequisites -DryRun

# Hour 0.5: Start actual migration
./MigrationRunbook.ps1 -Phase Prerequisites
./MigrationRunbook.ps1 -Phase Inventory

# Hour 1: User validation (if not done earlier)
./MigrationRunbook.ps1 -Phase UsersCheck

# Hour 2: Submit and approve (coordinate with target admin)
./MigrationRunbook.ps1 -Phase Submit
# Switch to target tenant
./MigrationRunbook.ps1 -Phase Approve

# Hour 3: Preparation phase
./MigrationRunbook.ps1 -Phase Prepare

# Hour 4+: Migration execution (longest phase)
./MigrationRunbook.ps1 -Phase Migrate

# Final: Post-migration tasks
./MigrationRunbook.ps1 -Phase PostMigration
```

### Monitoring During Migration
```powershell
# Continuous monitoring script
$migrationId = "your-migration-id"
$logFile = "migration-monitor.log"

do {
    $status = TenantToTenant-GetMigrationStatus -MigrationId $migrationId
    $timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
    $logEntry = "[$timestamp] Status: $($status.Status) | Progress: $($status.Progress)%"
    
    Write-Host $logEntry
    Add-Content -Path $logFile -Value $logEntry
    
    # Alert on status changes
    if ($lastStatus -ne $status.Status) {
        Send-TeamsChatNotification "Migration status changed to: $($status.Status)"
        $lastStatus = $status.Status
    }
    
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 300  # Check every 5 minutes
} while ($status.Status -in @("Running", "InProgress", "Queued"))
```

### Team Communication Template
```markdown
## Migration Status Update - [Timestamp]
**Phase:** [Current Phase]  
**Status:** [Green/Yellow/Red]  
**Progress:** [X]%  
**ETA:** [Estimated completion time]  
**Issues:** [None/List any issues]  
**Next Update:** [Time of next update]
```

## 🔧 Post-Migration Optimization

### Immediate Post-Migration (Day 1)
```powershell
# Validate critical flows
$criticalFlows = @("Invoice Processing", "Employee Onboarding", "Customer Service")
foreach ($flow in $criticalFlows) {
    $flowStatus = Get-AdminFlow -EnvironmentName $envId | 
                  Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -eq $flow}
    
    if (-not $flowStatus.Enabled) {
        Write-Warning "Critical flow '$flow' is not enabled!"
    }
}

# Test key connections
Get-AdminPowerAppConnectionReferences -EnvironmentName $envId | 
    Where-Object {$_.Status -ne "Connected"} |
    Format-Table Name, Status, Connector
```

### Week 1 Post-Migration

- [ ] **Critical business processes** tested end-to-end
- [ ] **User acceptance testing** completed
- [ ] **Performance benchmarking** against pre-migration metrics
- [ ] **External system integrations** re-enabled and tested
- [ ] **Documentation** updated with new tenant URLs

### Month 1 Post-Migration
- [ ] **Usage analytics** reviewed and compared to baseline
- [ ] **User feedback** collected and addressed
- [ ] **Performance optimization** implemented
- [ ] **Lessons learned** documented
- [ ] **Source environment** decommissioned (if applicable)

## 🔍 Quality Assurance

### Migration Testing Protocol
```powershell
# Automated testing script
function Test-MigrationQuality {
    param($SourceEnvId, $TargetEnvId)
    
    $results = @()
    
    # Test 1: Flow count validation
    $sourceFlows = Get-AdminFlow -EnvironmentName $SourceEnvId
    $targetFlows = Get-AdminFlow -EnvironmentName $TargetEnvId
    
    $results += @{
        Test = "Flow Count"
        Expected = $sourceFlows.Count
        Actual = $targetFlows.Count
        Status = if ($sourceFlows.Count -eq $targetFlows.Count) {"PASS"} else {"FAIL"}
    }
    
    # Test 2: App count validation
    $sourceApps = Get-AdminPowerApp -EnvironmentName $SourceEnvId
    $targetApps = Get-AdminPowerApp -EnvironmentName $TargetEnvId
    
    $results += @{
        Test = "App Count"
        Expected = $sourceApps.Count
        Actual = $targetApps.Count
        Status = if ($sourceApps.Count -eq $targetApps.Count) {"PASS"} else {"FAIL"}
    }
    
    return $results
}
```

### Acceptance Criteria

## 🌐 Multi-Geo Considerations

### Data Residency Requirements
- Verify target tenant is in correct geo for compliance
- Document any data sovereignty implications
- Plan for additional latency if crossing regions
- Consider local regulatory requirements

### Cross-Region Performance
```powershell
# Test cross-region latency
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName [target-region].api.powerapps.com -Port 443

# Expected latencies:
# Same region: <50ms
# Same continent: <150ms  
# Cross-continent: <300ms
```
